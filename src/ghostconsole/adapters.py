"""One tolerant adapter per Ghost tool.

Every adapter reads only that tool's published report artifacts, by
file name and documented shape, using nothing but the stdlib. No
sibling tool is imported or executed.

Tolerance rules, shared by all adapters:
- Missing tool: the section is ABSENT ("no report found"). Never an
  error, never affects anything beyond its own row.
- Present but unparseable: the section is UNREADABLE and says why.
- Present and parseable but with unrecognized fields: the section is
  OK with a summary that only claims what was recognized, or says the
  shape was not recognized in detail.
- Searches under a project are bounded (depth, visited-file cap,
  skipped directories, no symlink following, per-file size cap).
- Provenance: a report found under a test, fixture, or example
  directory is fixture material the project ships, not live state the
  project produced. Adapters search live paths first and only fall
  back to fixture paths when no live report exists; the section is
  then labelled "fixture" (see _provenance) and the classifier never
  lets it place the project.
